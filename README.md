# Merge_Bubble_Sort
Code implements both a conventional MergeSort algorithm and a MixSort algorithm, which is a combination of both MergeSort and BubbleSort. 
What's interesting is when comparing execution time, MixSort does better than MergeSort only. Algorithm was built with generics and is tested on random arrays of size 250000.
